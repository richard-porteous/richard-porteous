- 👋 Hi, I’m @richard-porteous
- 👀 I’m interested in most things technical. Solar panels, robotics etc. 
      Transfering knowledge to new things, and learning new ways to do the same thing, hopefully better.
- 🌱 Trained in electronics I’m currently learning for a Computer Science Degree. Already a software developer. #living-life-backwards.
      most of my life has been self directed learning.
- 💞️ I’m building a knowlege portfolio, something which I have neglected in the past.
- 📫 How to reach me ... (to be edited ... soon).
