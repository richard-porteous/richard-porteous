- 👋 Hi, I’m @richard-porteous
- 👀 I’m interested in most things technical. Solar panels, robotics etc. 
      But especially refactoring old code. Learning new ways to do the same thing, hopefully better.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning for a Computer Science Degree. Already a software developer. #living-life-backwards.
      most of my life has been self directed learning. Notable exception my electronics diploma.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on School projects, when they come up
- 📫 How to reach me ... (to be edited ... soon). Otherwise send a message through github
